This is the main script to calculate the cell area fraction based on a shapefile. 
In the calculation, the .shp file and resolution are used to produce a raster (.tiff) file
in which each gridd cell has the percent area that grid cell is covered by one or more polygons of the shapefile. 

The script makes use of the calc_areafrac_shp2rst function of the functions_cellareafraction.py file. 

The baseline and paths are user defined. 

! Attention: as the default resolution is 0.05Â°, the process can be time consuming (>2 days)
